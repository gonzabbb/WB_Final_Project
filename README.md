Green Air Green Corridor (CAGC) Community Engagement Website

Overview

Many schools in Washington Heights face challenges stemming from obstacles in their neighborhoods, such as:

Glass, litter, and needles scattered in public spaces.
Safety and security concerns impacting students' well-being.
The Green Air Green Corridor (CAGC) is an initiative aimed at creating a green space connecting multiple schools in the area. This program provides students with a safe environment where they can come together and embrace the positive aspects of their community.

Mission

The goal of this project is to support the CAGC initiative by creating a community engagement website. The website will enable residents to:

Map and track dangerous issues like litter, needles, and missing trees.
Highlight positive aspects of the neighborhood.
Facilitate data-driven improvements and foster community collaboration.
Background

The project originated from the challenges observed in Washington Heights schools. One of our team members, Abraham, who attended the Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School (WHEELS), introduced the idea of supporting CAGC.

CAGC, led by passionate community members and educators, has been fostering environmental improvement and community engagement since its inception.
